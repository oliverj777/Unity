The code found here provides both an interface for the use of dual stick game pads in Unity and a convenient method of setting up axis data in Unity's input manager.

As is, this material can be used to set up a PS3 dual shock control on OSX. It would not be difficult to extend this to other controllers and systems, provided an adequate set of drivers.

A simple piece of test code is provided to verify input data.

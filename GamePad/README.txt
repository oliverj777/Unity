The code found here provides both an interface for the use of dual stick game pads in Unity and a convenient method of setting up axis data in Unity's input manager.

As is, this material can be used to set up under OSX with: 

- PS3 dual shock control, using stock drivers
- Xbox control, using the driver implemented by Tattie Bogle (http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/OsxDriver)

It would not be difficult to extend this to other controllers and systems, provided an adequate set of drivers.

A simple piece of test code is provided to verify input data.

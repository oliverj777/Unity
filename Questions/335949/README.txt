This question was motivated by question 335949 in the Unity Developer's Network forum

http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/335949/camera-pan-problem.html

The author of the question presented a problem in their code and wanted to implement a control such that a camera would snap to a particular view point and then back to its origin. The code here does that, adding a little smoothing too.

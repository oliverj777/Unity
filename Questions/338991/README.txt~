The creation of this code was motivated by question 334774 in the Unity Developer Network's Questions forum:

http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/334774/adding-to-array-from-editor.html

The author of the question wished, for their own reasons, not to use the inspector in order to modify the properties of a scripted object but rather to use a custom editor window. This code demonstrates how this might be done. It is my view, that in cases such as this, that a custom inspector be implemented instead.
